# Robots8Puzzle
Artificial intelligence / swarm robotics project for a group of 8 robots to rearrange themselves in an 8-puzzle environment. Robots weren't explicitly programmed to perform certain moves, instead, they were informed of the initial state they were in and the goal state they needed to reach and they had to decide themselves how to coordinate as a group and reach the goal. Written in Python.
